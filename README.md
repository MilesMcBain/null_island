# Null Island

Welcome to Null Island.

This is a a visualisation of observed and projected South Pacific mean sea level rise from 1974 to 2100.

1974 - 2020 use the [NOAA Mean Sea Level trend from observations taken at Honiara, Solomon Islands](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/sltrends_global_station.htm?stnid=734-004).
2020 - 2100 data are a piece-wise linear approximation of the Regional Mean Sea Level model presented in [this summary](https://theconversation.com/15-years-from-now-our-impact-on-regional-sea-level-will-be-clear-31821) of **Lyu, K. et al., 2014. Time of emergence for regional sea-level change. Nature climate change, 4(11), p.nclimate2397.**

The visualisation is built with [A-Frame](https://aframe.io).

The island model is CC-by Google, [downloaded from the Google Poly repository](https://poly.google.com/view/fG9iP5afr7U), with minor modifications in Blender to make all faces double-sided.

The waves are made using the [Ocean AFrame component written by Don McCurdy](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras)
